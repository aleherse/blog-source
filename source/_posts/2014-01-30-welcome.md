One of my New Year's resolutions was to write a blog with all the things I'm learning in London and at least here it's
the very first post of, hopefully, many more to come.

My main goal is to write about things I bump into in books, articles, talks and conferences, my research about
the inner workings of Symfony and a way to share my solutions to some code katas.

Many thanks for coming here and I hope you like the content because everything is ready to go, let the journey begin!
