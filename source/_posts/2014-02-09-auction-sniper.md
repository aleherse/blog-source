title: Commissioning an Auction Sniper
draft: false

---
Currently I'm reading the book <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/" target="_blank">Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided by Tests</a>
and because I totally believe that the best way of learning is by doing, my plan is, as I read it, replicate
the development process using languages and tools I'm comfortable with or that I want to learn how to use. I will
create a branch per chapter or logic unit and merge them into master when finished, I will also try to provide
meaningful commits that are able to explain by themselves the followed process.

My intention is to make this process as much didactic as possible but, because it's my first approach to a full BDD
development of a complex application, it might end with some misconceptions, please feel free to open
issues and comment the code as I progress in this project.
